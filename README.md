# A Multinomial Naive Bayes Model for Spam Detection

## Problem Statement  
Spam emails pose a persistent challenge in digital communication. They clutter consumers' inboxes and create serious risks through malicious links. Accurately distinguishing spam from legitimate (ham) emails is therefore a critical task for cybersecurity.

## Goal
In this project, we implement a **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) classifier from scratch** to classify spam vs. ham emails. We then validate our implementation against **scikit-learn’s MultinomialNB** to test performance.


## Conclusion and Further Directions 
We implemented a Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) classifier from scratch for spam detection and validated it against scikit-learn’s MultinomialNB, achieving equivalent accuracy, precision, and recall. This confirms the reliability of our approach while underscoring the practical importance of spam filtering for email security and user experience.  
- Explore different text classification models, such as bag-of-words and TF-IDF  
- Test alternative models (e.g., logistic regression, random forests, SVM)  
- Improve preprocessing with stemming, lemmatization, and handling irregular punctuation
