        "# Spam Email Classification\n",
        "This project focuses on spam email classification, a task with strong business relevance since spam filtering protects users from phishing, reduces security risks, and saves productivity. We will implement a Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) classifier from scratch to detect spam emails. To validate our implementation, we compare it against scikit-learn’s built-in MultinomialNB. We aim to highlight how the choice between raw counts and weighted features affects a model’s ability to distinguish spam from legitimate messages."

ft mccarthy\\nthe troubles of enron , a texan powerhouse in the energy markets , could result in a new financial crisis\\njust last year , visitors to enron \\' s glittering headquarters in houston were greeted by a giant banner that proclaimed the firm , \" the world \\' s leading energy company \" . that annoyed enron \\' s smaller energy - trading rivals , many of which have offices only a stone \\' s throw away in houston \\' s energy alley , but not as much as what came next - a new banner , declaring enron \" the world \\' s leading company \" . in recent weeks , as the company has been engulfed by a financial crisis , that banner has quietly been removed .\\nthe heady mix of audacity , ambition and arrogance revealed by the banners is as good a guide as any to enron \\' s remarkable rise and fall . forged in the 1980 s by the merger of two troubled gas - pipeline firms , enron drove the development of the sophisticated spot - and - derivatives markets in energy that it has come to dominate . indeed , such is the scale of its operations , and its dealings with many of the world \\' s financial institutions , that some observers see parallels with long - term capital management ( ltcm ) , the hedge fund that failed in 1998 - and not just because seemingly brilliant financial alchemists have been humbled . were enron to go bust - unlikely , but in the current nervous climate , not impossible - might a crisis ensue ?\\ntroubles in california \\' s politically crazed power market , an ill - advised foray into telecoms bandwidth trading and concerns about management badly dented enron \\' s share price earlier this year , prompting the departure of jeffrey skilling , the firm \\' s newish chief executive , in august . kenneth lay , an avid free - marketeer , friend of george bush and visionary chairman of the firm , was obliged to resume hands - on control .\\nthis has not slowed enron \\' s decline . day by day , it seems to be sinking deeper into a financial quagmire that is largely of its own creation . not least thanks to its lack of transparency , the firm \\' s credibility with the markets has eroded to the point that talk of a possible takeover or even bankruptcy is widespread .\\nenron \\' s reputation for financial wizardry has been turned from an asset to a liability since its third - quarter results came out in mid - october , showing a $ 1 billion write - off on water distribution , broadband trading and other investments . worse , disclosed only in passing by mr lay in a conference call with analysts , the firm suffered a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in capital , stemming from a hedging deal with a related private - equity fund called ljm . the charge was due to enron \\' s forced sale of 55 m of its own shares when the partnership was unwound this summer . almost nobody outside enron had been aware of the terms of the deal with ljm , a \" structured finance vehicle \" .\\nenron \\' s failure to offer details about the risks from other related partnerships have led many to fear the worst about its huge balance sheet . its shares plunged by 19 % on october 30 th alone ( see chart on next page ) , before recovering a bit the next day .\\nandrew fastow , who was replaced as chief financial officer on october 24 th , was a general partner in ljm . jeffrey mcmahon , his successor , has much to do to restore confidence . questions abound . were the trusts run at arm \\' s length ? what did mr fastow earn from the partnership ? ominously , the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) has now launched a formal inquiry .\\nmoody \\' s , a rating agency , last week cut its rating on the company \\' s debt to barely above \" junk \" level . further downgrades might unleash claims from other off - balance - sheet partnerships . those known about , such as atlantic water and marlin water , do not seem big enough to bankrupt enron , but speculation is rife about what other obligations might lurk secretly in other structured vehicles .\\na lower credit rating could destroy enron \\' s core franchise as the leading energy middleman , by scaring away customers and freezing the wholesale energy markets . that might have nasty consequences in other markets . enron acknowledges that it is a large participant in the derivatives market , holding a portfolio with a notional value of $ 21 billion . rightly or wrongly , many traders believe that figure vastly understates enron \\' s presence . if the firms on the other side of enron \\' s trades start to fear that payment is not coming , they might curb their other trading , producing a knock - on effect . where this could end up is a subject of much conjecture .\\nutilities that trade energy could be hit . so could the commodity and derivative operations of large commercial and investment banks . the ties are notably tight between enron and j . p . morgan chase , according to ventana capital , a research firm . not only does j . p . morgan provide innumerable separate credit arrangements for enron ; it also has the largest derivative operation of any bank , as well as a large business trading commodities . there is \" no doubt \" that enron is on the other side of many j . p . morgan trades , says ventana .\\nwere enron to fail , ventana thinks \" it has the potential to cause a major financial crisis \" , worse , in some ways , than what occurred after ltcm . that merely froze the debt markets temporarily , whereas enron deals in the building - blocks of the american economy . imagine gridlock in the markets for gas , timber , coal , metals , fertiliser , bandwidth or indeed any of the products enron deals in .\\nas yet , this all seems unlikely . many big traders were happy to deal with enron this week , although at shorter maturities and with less complex structures than in the past . trading on enrononline was reportedly strong . jim donnell of duke energy , a big energy trader , described \" a huge dichotomy \" between the collapse in confidence in enron in the equity and credit markets and the \" business as usual \" attitude taken by big commodity trading firms when considering enron as a counterparty .\\nyet as questions about enron \\' s credit - standing spread this week , it began to have difficulty making markets in some instruments . few firms would accept enron \\' s name as guarantor of a credit derivative . in its core energy markets some big trading counterparties refused the enron name . on the intercontinental exchange ( ice ) , two houses reportedly specified that they would not take enron \\' s credit .\\nthe biggest credit exposure appeared to be with banks , whose $ 3 billion of back - up lines to enron were drawn down last week . j . p . morgan arranged an additional $ 1 billion emergency credit - line this week . this back - up , it is widely assumed , is needed mainly to meet margin calls triggered by the ratings downgrade .\\ntoo big to fail ?\\nis enron too big and too important to be allowed to fail ? philip verleger , an energy economist , thinks that enron is so central to energy markets that it could not easily be replaced . enron \\' s rivals mostly disagree , unsurprisingly .\\nbut even enron \\' s worst enemies do not ( yet ) expect the firm to die from its current crisis . most traders seem keen that it should live . \" nobody likes to see a wholesale trader disappear , \" says one . they admire enron \\' s armies of traders and their ability to do deals . enrononline is one of the internet \\' s few success stories , assuming its huge trading volumes do indeed generate big profits , as the firm claims .\\nenron \\' s , and the financial system \\' s , problems could worsen if doubts grow about its ability to meet its obligations . on the surface it is rich in assets , if not cash . but its lack of transparency leaves uncomfortable room for doubt . in june 2000 , the economist challenged mr lay to reply to accusations of arrogance , high - handedness and a propensity to push the limits of the law . his response was revealing . to show that such charges were baseless , he pointed to another firm unfairly maligned by critics : drexel burnham lambert , an investment bank that rose from obscurity to market prominence in the junk - bond boom of the 1980 s . drexel was accused of arrogance , he groused , but it was only being \" very innovative and very aggressive \" . drexel was not bailed out : michael milken , its star , ended up in jail , and drexel collapsed in a heap of bad debts and ignominy .\\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\\nenron gets $ 1 billion new credit line , but must pledge top gas -

b from triple - b - plus and short - term debt to single - a - 3 from single - a - 2 , citing a belief that enron \\' s planned sale of assets \" will be insufficient to restore its long - term credit quality \" to historic levels . moody \\' s investors service inc . had issued debt downgrades earlier this week .\\ns & p also lowered ratings on the debt of enron \\' s pipeline systems , transwestern pipeline co . and northern natural gas co . , that were used to collateralize a $ 1 billion bank borrowing from j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . \\' s salomon smith barney unit . enron said it would use the money from the 364 - day credit lines to refinance roughly $ 250 million in maturing obligations , leaving it $ 750 million to boost short - term liquidity .\\nin dropping the pipeline credit ratings by two notches , s & p noted that the assets have become \" more strategic to the company , \" in part because they can be relied upon to consistently make money , unlike many other enron hard - asset investments .\\nthe pipelines produced $ 450 million in gas - transport revenue and an $ 85 million pretax profit in the third quarter on generally rising rates . that compared with revenue of $ 424 million for enron \\' s foreign assets that scraped by with a $ 19 million earnings contribution .\\ntodd shipman , credit analyst for s & p , said there have been concerns that enron might take on too much debt , trying to prove it has enough cash on hand to meet its energy - trading obligations . but he said s & p wasn \\' t worried by the most recent borrowing , because \" we don \\' t think it will be a permanent part of the balance sheet . \" however , he added that the amount of additional debt it can take on top of the $ 13 billion it now has outstanding is \" little to none . \" with the sharp fall in its stock price , enron \\' s market capitalization is now around $ 10 billion .\\nan enron spokesman said \" it should be a nonissue \" because the company has no intention of borrowing more money anytime soon .\\nin announcing the borrowing plan , enron \\' s new chief financial officer , jeff mcmahon , said it was a move to \" enhance investor confidence . \" but stock - market investors reacted otherwise and enron stock gave up most of wednesday \\' s gain , closing at $ 11 . 99 , down $ 1 . 91 , or 14 % , in 4 p . m . new york stock exchange composite trading . with many enron bonds trading at two - thirds of their par value , bondholders didn \\' t seem comforted either .\\nenron has been in a defensive posture since it announced a third - quarter loss of $ 618 million two weeks ago , followed by news that it also took a $ 1 . 2 billion equity write - down , based partly on transactions involving a handful of its own officers . the company replaced its chief financial officer , andrew fastow , after the securities and exchange commission began an inquiry into related - party transactions . enron on wednesday disclosed that the inquiry had been elevated to a formal probe .\\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones section c\\nenron \\' s shares fall and debt rating is cut\\nby richard a . oppel jr .\\n11 / 02 / 2001\\nthe new york times\\npage 11 , column 1\\nc . 2001 new york times company\\ndallas , nov . 1 -

balance - sheet debts and transactions with investment partnerships involving the company \\' s former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who was ousted last week . enron shares fell $ 1 . 91 today , to $ 11 . 99 .\\nsome analysts are beginning to attribute a swift recent rally in natural gas prices in part to the possibility that a collapse of enron would roil the commodity markets . enron dominates natural gas and electricity trading in the united states .\\nin new york today , natural gas for december delivery fell 0 . 1 cent , to $ 3 . 29 for a million british thermal units . the contract has soared from about $ 2 . 70 over the last two weeks as enron \\' s troubles became public .\\n\\' \\' enron has a massive exposure to both the buy side and the sell side in gas and other commodities , \\' \\' said jay saunders , oil and gas analyst at deutsche banc alex . brown , \\' \\' and if they \\' re at risk financially , then you \\' re exposed to that so you want to cover that risk . anybody who has enron as a counterparty in a trade might be concerned about getting paid . \\' \\'\\nmr . saunders added that other factors had also lifted prices lately , including falling rates of gas being put in storage for use this winter .\\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones metro desk\\nthe state calpers is urged to challenge enron finance : the public employee pension fund holds 3 million shares of the energy firm , whose stock has plunged . state senator calls for action .\\nnancy vogel\\ntimes staff writer\\n11 / 02 / 2001\\nlos angeles times\\nhome edition\\nb -

enron activist abhay mehta said . in practical terms , he said , the only player to benefit from a sale is enron corp which is desperately looking to sell its stake .\\nsuch a prospect leaves some grey areas about the future of the judicial inquiry ordered recently by the democratic front government . the probe is yet to get under way and the supreme court case against the project is pending hearing .\\nwhile officials admit that legally the actions will continue , it will not be as effective as if the company is still in the field . it is also possible to come to a mutually acceptable settlement before enron exits the country or speed up the actions , they say .\\n` ` these repercussions are secondary ; the moot point is a speedy solution to the enron issue , \\' \\' says an official .\\nmr mehta says the fact that chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already agreed to an extension for the judicial probe beyond six months , ` ` if it is found necessary \\' \\' suggests that the government ` ` is not really serious about solving the issue but will rather keep dragging the case till the chickens come home to roost and some political points are scored . \\' \\'\\n` ` the state government \\' s attitude is like that of an ostrich : if you ignore a problem long enough , it will go away , \\' \\' he says .\\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\\ndabhol lenders \\' meet in london cancelled\\nour bureau mumbai\\n11 / 02 / 2001\\nbusiness standard\\n2\\ncopyright ( c ) business standard\\nthe meeting of the lenders of the enron -

        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, we successfully implemented a Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) classifier from scratch to detect spam emails. After cleaning and tokenizing the email text, we calculated word probabilities for each class and predicted labels for test messages. To validate our implementation, we compared it against scikit-learn’s MultinomialNB, and achieved equivalent accuracy, precision, and recall, confirming the reliability of our from-scratch model. The project demonstrates the practical significance of spam detection in improving email security as well as enhancing overall user experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Further Directions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Experiment with alternative text classification models such as bag-of-words, or TF-IDF, to see if they improve performance.\n",
        "2. Try different classification models not specifically for text classification, such as logisitic regression, random forests, or SVM.  \n",
